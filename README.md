## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is a monorepo containing two main folders:

* `/frontend`: Contains all the client-side static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images).
* `/backend`: Contains the Node.js/Express server, API routes, controllers, and database models.

## üèÅ Getting Started (Local Setup)

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
* Node.js (v18 or higher)
* npm (or another package manager)
* MongoDB (either a local instance or a free Atlas account)
* Git

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Chandan785/Edu-nnect.git .
    cd Edu-nnect
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder and add the following variables. **Do not include quotes.**

    ```env
    # --- .env file for backend ---

    # Server Port
    PORT=3000

    # MongoDB Connection String (from MongoDB Atlas)
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

    # CORS Origin for local frontend (adjust port if needed)
    CORS_ORIGIN=[http://127.0.0.1:5500](http://127.0.0.1:5500)

    # JWT Secrets (generate your own random strings)
    ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your-access-token-secret
    ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY=1d
    REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=your-refresh-token-secret
    REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY=10d

    # Cloudinary Credentials
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
    ```

3.  **Run the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    Your backend API should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

4.  **Set up the Frontend:**
    * There are no dependencies to install for the frontend.
    * The easiest way to run it is with a live server extension. For example, if you use VS Code, you can install the "Live Server" extension.
    * Right-click on the `frontend/index.html` file and choose "Open with Live Server". This will open the website, usually on a port like `5500`.
